"""Collect orbit renders into the project page, resolving runs via mapping.json.

Every method shown on the page — ours and baselines alike — is a **label from
`mapping.json`'s benchmark registry** (`benchmark.baselines` / `davis_sources`),
the same entries `sync_benchs.py` reads to fill the paper's result CSVs. The page
therefore shows the runs the tables score, by construction: `DATASETS` below
declares WHICH labels each dataset offers (and at which view counts), the
registry says WHERE each one's runs live, and the only discovery left is per
declared run dir — which scenes have an orbit render
(`scripts/visualization/render_final_results.py -r orbit`).

Videos and stills are both **re-encoded for the web in the copy step**, mirroring
how `update_qualitative.py` converts the paper's figure renders to JPEG on copy:
H.264 / yuv420p / Main profile / `+faststart` for video, `--still-format` for
stills. The supplementary ZIP has a size budget the renderer's output does not
respect. README.md carries the measured size/quality tables for both.

# `title` is the benchmark alone on both pages: which KIND of figure it is comes
# from the page it is on, so "GSO-30 - appearance ladder" only repeated the
# heading above it.
# `page` picks which HTML file shows it -- the four cross-method comparisons on
# qualitative.html, the four appearance ladders on ablations.html, mirroring the
# supplementary's own "Additional Results" / "Extended ablations" split. Each
# page's mount div names the group it wants (`data-figures`).
# `gt` is (train-stem, test-stem); a None test stem is the paper's blank tile
# (DAVIS has no ground truth for a synthesized view). `pool` is (subdir, stems)
# for the figure's input-view column, drawn as its own small grid.

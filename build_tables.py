"""Replicate the paper's quantitative tables on the project page.

Reads the **same** `csv/*.csv` files the paper bakes from and reuses
`regen_tables.py`'s table registry, column specs and ranking primitives
(`TABLES`, `parse_float`, `top_ranks`), so the numbers, the column selection and
the best/second-best marking are identical to the paper by construction — down
to the typefaces they are marked in, bold and underline. Only the rendering
layer differs: HTML instead of LaTeX.

    csv/*.csv ──┬── regen_tables.py ──> baked/tables-baked.tex   (paper)
                └── build_tables.py  ──> webpage/tables.js       (this page)

So the refresh path is unchanged: `python update_all_results.py` rewrites the
CSVs, then `python regen_tables.py` and this script re-emit from them.

    python paper/webpage/build_tables.py             # write tables.js + verify
    python paper/webpage/build_tables.py --no-verify

`--verify` (on by default) cross-checks every table against the baked LaTeX: the
multiset of numeric cells and of rank-marked cells must match. Since the
grouping/ranking loop here is a second implementation of `bake_table`'s, that
check is what keeps the two from drifting apart silently.

# its AJ and Anch. columns are unique, and dropping the section drops those
